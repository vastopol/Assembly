; Patterns.a- 	This file contains all the patterns and strings which the
;		program uses.  It is included rather than compiled separately
;		only because these patterns are only used in the main
;		program.  These patterns appear in a separate file because
;		they cause too much of a distraction in the main program.
;
;
;
;
; The following macro generates a pattern which will match a single word
; which appears anywhere on a line:

MatchWord	macro		Name, WordStr
		local		WS1, WS2, WS3, WS4

Name		Pattern		{MatchStr, WordStr, WS2, MatchSpc}
WS2		Pattern		{arb,0,0,WS3}
WS3		Pattern		{Matchchar, ' ',0, WS4}
WS4		Pattern		{MatchStr, WordStr, 0, MatchEOS}
		endm


; Generic patterns which most of the patterns use:

MatchEOS	Pattern		{EOS,0,MatchSpc,0}
MatchSpc	Pattern		{MatchChar,' '}


; Okay, set up the patterns to match GO, NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST:

GoStr		byte		"GO",0

SouthStr	byte		"SOUTH",0
EastStr		byte		"EAST",0
